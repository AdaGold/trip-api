# Trip API™

Welcome to the Trip API™™™, that services the Ada Trip Reserving Service!

The Ada Trip Reserving Service does two things very well:
  1. helps tour guides create Trip packages catered to global travelers
  2. helps travelers find Trip packages that fit their needs, and make a reservation for that trip
